        <h2>A few fun facts</h2>
        <p>
          I love french press coffee, I have a cat
          named after MacGyver, my favorite number
          is 22, not a huge fan of IPAs, I play video
          games like it's my life, I knew what I wanted
          to do at the age of 13, I do downhill
          mountain biking, my favorite food is bacon
          and I broke my left arm twice.

        <h2>A look into my life</h2>
        <p>
          During the warmer months, I enjoy traveling to
          some great downhill mountain biking locations
          or finding a remote lake somewhere new for
          kayaking. Although the majority of the year,
          you will find me behind a computer screen. I
          am a passionate gamer which has had a huge
          impact on the start of my career, but that's
          a story for another time.
